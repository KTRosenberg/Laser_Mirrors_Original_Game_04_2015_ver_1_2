LASER MIRRORS:

OBJECTIVE:
Laser Mirrors is a fast-paced mini-game
The game map consists of an overhead view on 8 mirrors.
The player controls the 8 mirrors simultaneously, rotating them to guide a player "laser" towards blue point markers.
The goal is to earn as many points as possible within the time limit, or to achieve a new personal high score. (The game stores a record of the high score and displays it.)

POINT SYSTEM:
The more point markers collected consecutively (without losing the laser), the greater the points earned per marker. Initially each marker is worth 500 points, but this number is multiplied by 2 as more markers are collected consecutively
If the laser goes out-of-bounds or hits/is absorbed into the short side of a mirror accidentally, the player loses 1000 points, the laser resets at its default location, and the multiplier resets.

CONTROLS:

	Use the arrow keys to control the mirrors.
	
	UP or DOWN: 					|
	LEFT or RIGHT: 				    -
	UP AND LEFT or DOWN AND RIGHT:  /
	DOWN AND LEFT OR UP AND RIGHT:  \
		PLEASE NOTE:
		HOLD the keys and switch key combinations as though the arrow keys were an analogue stick. (The positions of the keys capture the angle of each mirror)
		The controls feel intuitive this way, and they respond best when used this way as well. 
		There is a learning curve, and there is thought involved, 
		as the controls do not correspond with the direction the player wants the laser to move, but rather the angle of the mirrors. 
		The player must think about the movement of the mirror as it relates to the angle of the mirror
		DO NOT TAP THE KEYS

	MOVEMENT:
	
	Imagine that the laser moves rightwards:
	
		REFLECTS DIRECTLY BACKWARDS if a mirror surface is flat towards the direction of movement
		L ------> |
		L<------- |
		
		REFLECTS AT A RIGHT ANGLE if a mirror is angled at 45ยบ
				  ^
				  |
				  |
		L ------> /
		L ------> \
				  |
				  |
				  
		AVOID hitting the SHORT SIDE of a mirror. The laser will be absorbed, the point multiplier will reset, the player will lose 1000 points, and the laser will reset at the bottom of the screen
		
		L ------> -
				  x
	
		HINT: Sometimes it is a good idea to bounce back and forth between the flat sides of a pair of mirrors, 
			  as doing so allows for time to think in exchange for time on the timer.
			  The goal is still to think of the fastest routes to collect the point markers without losing points.
			  
	SHIFT + Mouse Click to save high score (if the previous high score was beaten during the game) and exit the game
